## Description 

### Bird Abundance

We used data the Audubon CBC, a bird monitoring program initiated in 1900 focus in identify and count wintering birds within circles of 24-km diameter. We focused our analysis on 1967-2018 and 1,183 locations across the United States. Considering the number of individuals observed per species in the different locations over time, we used N-mixture models to estimate abundance corrected for species imperfect detection. 

### Bird Traits

We used four trait categories (i.e., body mass, morphological characteristics, diet and foraging niche) to classified all species observed over time. The trait data were collected from Tobias et al. (2022) and Wilman et al. (2014).
